# Kat-Api
An API for [my discord bot](https://github.com/reignbit/java-discord-kat). This was originally made without using version control and I lost the source code
during a server upgrade. Now it lives here...

Currently it has basic support required for the Discord bot to work, in the future it will have full support
for all the current commands/systems of Kat.

## Requirements
- node & npm
- express
- mongoose

## How to run
- Download the ZIP or checkout the repo
- Edit `config.json.default` to your liking, rename to `config.json` when finished.
- Extract and run `npm run dev`. This starts the server in nodemon, which will automatically restart on any code changes.
